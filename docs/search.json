    "text": "Hi, I’m Mert!\n\nI’m a Psychology Ph.D. candidate in the Cognitive Development Lab at New York University. My research explores the role of children’s actions and parent-child interactions in language development, as well as how language shapes the mind, particularly its role in reasoning and making sense of the world. I also study how children and adults use language to understand their world; specifically, how they generate explanations and the cognitive processes that support this ability. I extend this framework into artificial intelligence by studying the reasoning processes within Large Language Models (LLMs) and in interactions between LLMs and humans, aiming to understand their capabilities and limitations as cognitive agents.\n\nI hold a Bachelor of Arts in Educational Sciences from Boğaziçi University and a Master of Arts in Psychology from Koç University.\n\nOutside the lab, I enjoy reading, watching anime, exercising, playing guitar, and gaming. I’m passionate about developing and exploring data analysis, machine learning and AI models. Feel free to check out some of my recent projects!"

The object exploration and parents’ spatial input at Time 1 were coded from the semi-structured free play sessions, and infant spatial language was assessed via a parental report at Time 2. Our results showed no differences between preterm and full-term groups on object exploration. However, parents’ spatial input differed based on neonatal condition, in which preterm infants received less input than full-term infants. Parents’ spatial input co-occurred with 44% of the object exploration events, with a significant difference between groups (preterm: M = 36.1%; full-term: M = 52.1%). Importantly, the interaction between object exploration and parents’ spatial input at Time 1 predicted children’s spatial language knowledge at Time 2 regardless of children’s neonatal status. Infants who explored objects for longer periods and received greater spatial input from their parents at Time 1 knew more spatial words at Time 2 than infants who explored objects less and received less input at Time 1. These findings suggest that early object exploration and parents’ spatial input together can lead to a cascading effect on later spatial language development for both preterm and full-term infants.\nClick here to read this article!"

Parents’ spatial input co-occurred with 44% of the object exploration events, with a significant difference between groups (preterm: M = 36.1%; full-term: M = 52.1%). Importantly, the interaction between object exploration and parents’ spatial input at Time 1 predicted children’s spatial language knowledge at Time 2 regardless of children’s neonatal status. Infants who explored objects for longer periods and received greater spatial input from their parents at Time 1 knew more spatial words at Time 2 than infants who explored objects less and received less input at Time 1. These findings suggest that early object exploration and parents’ spatial input together can lead to a cascading effect on later spatial language development for both preterm and full-term infants.\nClick here to read this article!"

At Time 1 (Mage = 14 months, N = 73, 36 PT) and Time 2 (Mage = 20.1 months, N = 61, 27 PT), PT infants’ parents produced fewer frequent multimodal input (i.e., co-speech deictic gestures) than FT infants’ parents.

Parents’ verbal input was concurrently associated with infants’ receptive vocabulary at 14 months, yet parents’ multimodal input was only linked to PT infants’ receptive vocabulary. At 20 months, parents’ verbal input was not related to expressive vocabulary in either group; however, parents’ multimodal input was again associated with PT infants’ expressive vocabulary scores. Parents’ multimodal input at 14 months predicted infants’ expressive vocabulary scores at 20 months, only for the PT group.

Infants’ visual processing, fine and gross motor skills were tested using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Parents reported on infants’ language skills (word comprehension and early communicative behavior), using the Turkish version of CDI (TCDI). Results showed that PT infants performed worse than their FT peers on gross motor skills and visual processing, but not on language. When controlling for age and neonatal condition (being preterm or not), visual processing mediated the relation between gross motor skills and word comprehension as well as early communicative behavior. However, for fine motor skills, visual processing mediated the relation between fine motor skills and early communicative behavior but not word comprehension. The relations between motor skills and visual processing were more robust for the PT group than the FT group. Following developmental cascades, these findings suggest that motor skills contribute to language development through visual processing. These relations are prominent for preterm infants who have delays in motor skills.

    "text": "There is a consensus that spatial language supports spatial reasoning. However, it remains a question of how specific spatial terms (e.g., prepositions) relate to distinct spatial skills that are critical for spatial cognition (e.g., mental transformation). We asked whether 1) preschoolers’ spatial language skills, particularly knowledge of postpositions, were linked to their mental transformation abilities, and 2) other cognitive factors such as reasoning about relations were associated with this link. Turkish-speaking preschool-aged children (Mage = 53 months) completed spatial language (i.e., postposition comprehension and production), spatial reasoning (i.e., mental transformation), relational reasoning, cognitive inhibition, and general vocabulary knowledge tasks. Results showed that older children performed better on all tasks, except the relational reasoning one. Children’s mental transformation performance was associated with their postposition knowledge and relational reasoning performance, beyond general vocabulary knowledge and cognitive inhibition. These findings present evidence on the link between spatial language and spatial reasoning from Turkish-learning preschool-aged children and emphasize the role of other cognitive factors such as relational reasoning on mental transformation."

Two question categories in CRAFT include previously studied descriptive and counterfactual questions. Additionally, inspired by the Force Dynamics Theory in cognitive linguistics, we introduce a new causal question category that involves understanding the causal interactions between objects through notions like cause, enable, and prevent. Our results show that even though the questions in CRAFT are easy for humans, the tested baseline models, including existing state-of-the-art methods, do not yet deal with the challenges posed in our benchmark.\nClick here to read this article!"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThere is a consensus that spatial language supports spatial reasoning. However, it remains a question of how specific spatial terms (e.g., prepositions) relate to distinct spatial skills that are critical for spatial cognition (e.g., mental transformation). We asked whether 1) preschoolers’ spatial language skills, particularly knowledge of postpositions, were linked to their mental transformation abilities, and 2) other cognitive factors such as reasoning about relations were associated with this link. Turkish-speaking preschool-aged children (Mage = 53 months) completed spatial language (i.e., postposition comprehension and production), spatial reasoning (i.e., mental transformation), relational reasoning, cognitive inhibition, and general vocabulary knowledge tasks. Results showed that older children performed better on all tasks, except the relational reasoning one. Children’s mental transformation performance was associated with their postposition knowledge and relational reasoning performance, beyond general vocabulary knowledge and cognitive inhibition. These findings present evidence on the link between spatial language and spatial reasoning from Turkish-learning preschool-aged children and emphasize the role of other cognitive factors such as relational reasoning on mental transformation."

    "text": "We directly compare the persuasion capabilities of a frontier large language model (LLM; Claude Sonnet 3.5) against incentivized human persuaders in an interactive, real-time conversational quiz setting. In this preregistered, large-scale incentivized experiment, participants (quiz takers) completed an online quiz where persuaders (either humans or LLMs) attempted to persuade quiz takers toward correct or incorrect answers. We find that LLM persuaders achieved significantly higher compliance with their directional persuasion attempts than incentivized human persuaders, demonstrating superior persuasive capabilities in both truthful (toward correct answers) and deceptive (toward incorrect answers) contexts. We also find that LLM persuaders significantly increased quiz takers’ accuracy, leading to higher earnings, when steering quiz takers toward correct answers, and significantly decreased their accuracy, leading to lower earnings, when steering them toward incorrect answers. Overall, our findings suggest that AI’s persuasion capabilities already exceed those of humans that have real-money bonuses tied to performance. Our findings of increasingly capable AI persuaders thus underscore the urgency of emerging alignment and governance frameworks.\nClick here to read!"
