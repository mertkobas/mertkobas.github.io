    "text": "Hi, I’m Mert!\n\nI’m a Psychology Ph.D. candidate in the Cognitive Development Lab at New York University. My research explores the role of children’s actions and parent-child interactions in language development, as well as how language shapes the mind, particularly its role in reasoning and making sense of the world. I also study how children and adults use language to understand their world; specifically, how they generate explanations and the cognitive processes that support this ability. I extend this framework into artificial intelligence by studying the reasoning processes within Large Language Models (LLMs) and in interactions between LLMs and humans, aiming to understand their capabilities and limitations as cognitive agents.\n\nI hold a Bachelor of Arts in Educational Sciences from Boğaziçi University and a Master of Arts in Psychology from Koç University.\n\nOutside the lab, I enjoy reading, watching anime, exercising, playing guitar, and gaming. I’m passionate about developing and exploring data analysis, machine learning and AI models. Feel free to check out some of my recent projects!"

    "text": "Investigating the relation among object exploration, parents’ spatial input, and spatial language development in preterm and full-term infants.\nPreterm and full-term groups were similar in object exploration but received different spatial input.\nParents’ spatial input co-occurred with object exploration events, was lower for preterm infants.\nThe interaction between object exploration and parents’ spatial input at 14 months predicted spatial language at 26 months regardless of the neonatal condition.\nThis interaction may lead to a cascading effect on spatial language development.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfants learn object features and relations among objects by exploring them. Object exploration and parents’ verbal input related to these spatial characteristics may lead to cascades for the development of spatial language. This longitudinal study examined whether infant object exploration and parents’ spatial input at Time 1 (Mage = 13.7 months) predicted spatial language of preterm infants (mean gestational age = 30 weeks) and full-term infants (mean gestational age = 38.9 weeks) at Time 2 (Mage = 26 months). The object exploration and parents’ spatial input at Time 1 were coded from the semi-structured free play sessions, and infant spatial language was assessed via a parental report at Time 2. Our results showed no differences between preterm and full-term groups on object exploration. However, parents’ spatial input differed based on neonatal condition, in which preterm infants received less input than full-term infants. Parents’ spatial input co-occurred with 44% of the object exploration events, with a significant difference between groups (preterm: M = 36.1%; full-term: M = 52.1%). Importantly, the interaction between object exploration and parents’ spatial input at Time 1 predicted children’s spatial language knowledge at Time 2 regardless of children’s neonatal status. Infants who explored objects for longer periods and received greater spatial input from their parents at Time 1 knew more spatial words at Time 2 than infants who explored objects less and received less input at Time 1. These findings suggest that early object exploration and parents’ spatial input together can lead to a cascading effect on later spatial language development for both preterm and full-term infants.\nClick here to read this article!"

    "text": "Language development is intertwined with motor development. This study examined how visual processing might mediate the relation between language development and motor skills in preterm (PT, n = 34, Mean gestational age = 30 weeks) and full-term infants (FT, n = 35, Mean gestational age = 38.9 weeks) at 13 months of age. Infants’ visual processing, fine and gross motor skills were tested using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Parents reported on infants’ language skills (word comprehension and early communicative behavior), using the Turkish version of CDI (TCDI). Results showed that PT infants performed worse than their FT peers on gross motor skills and visual processing, but not on language. When controlling for age and neonatal condition (being preterm or not), visual processing mediated the relation between gross motor skills and word comprehension as well as early communicative behavior. However, for fine motor skills, visual processing mediated the relation between fine motor skills and early communicative behavior but not word comprehension. The relations between motor skills and visual processing were more robust for the PT group than the FT group. Following developmental cascades, these findings suggest that motor skills contribute to language development through visual processing. These relations are prominent for preterm infants who have delays in motor skills. PT children’s limited interactions with their environment due to problems in motor skills can be connected to delays in visual processing.\nClick here to read this article!"

Specific input for spatial features (i.e., size, shape, features of objects) can be related to object word comprehension in early vocabulary development. In a longitudinal study, we investigated whether fine motor abilities at 14 months and parental input for spatial features at 19 months predicted object word comprehension at 25 months. Twenty-seven Turkish-learning children were tested at three time points (Time 1: Mage = 14.4 months, Time 2: Mage = 18.6 months, Time 3: Mage = 25 months). We measured word comprehension through the parental report and fine motor abilities with Mullen at Time 1. We used a puzzle play session to assess parental input for spatial features at Time 2 and a standardized receptive vocabulary test at Time 3. We found that fine motor abilities were related to object word comprehension. However, parental input for spatial features at 19 months predicted object word comprehension at 25 months beyond fine motor abilities at 14 months. Early fine motor abilities and using different words for spatial features may foster infants’ visual experiences in play and exploration episodes, leading to better object word learning.\nClick here to read this article!"
